# Portfolio-Analysis-Pandas

## Background

We have been presented with the task of identifying which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. This file will outline the creation of a python notebook that analyzes which portfolio outperformed the others. We are given the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. Use this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500 Index).
